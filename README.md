[ISO-TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15765-2) is an international standard for transmitting data larger than 8 bytes via a CAN network. This port of the [ISOTP-C](https://github.com/Beatsleigher/isotp-c) library is designed to work on all platforms with C++. A future version with/for C#/.NET is also a possibility.
