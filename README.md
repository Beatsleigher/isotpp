# isotpp
[ISO-TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15765-2) is an international standard for transmitting data larger than 8 bytes via a CAN network. This port of the [ISOTP-C](https://github.com/Beatsleigher/isotp-c) library is designed to work on all platforms with C++. A future version with/for C#/.NET is also a possibility. 

# Design Goals

The goal for this library, is to port my fork of the isotp-c library to full C++, while adding features to make other developers' lives easier.
Some of the QoL improvements/goals are listed below:

## QoL (Quality of Life) Improvements

 - Full use of C++ capabilities while remaining as compatible as possible
 - Automatic message polling
 - Thread safety
 - Ease of use
 - Good documentation
 - Platform independance (as far as C++ allows)
